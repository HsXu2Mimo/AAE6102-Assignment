# AAE6102-Assignment (2021-10-31)


## Intorduction

The aim of the assessment is to using the least-squares (LS) approach to solve the receiver location. 
The raw measuremnt is an 8x7 matrix containing raw ranging information as rcvr.dat
The ephemeris data is an 8 x 24 matrix as eph.dat

## Instructions
1. Download 'lib' and 'code' folders
   - download the zip file and extract to desired folder
   - add the 'lib' into the matlab path 
2. Open file '[Main_code](Main_code.m)' in MATLAB
3. Press 'Run'

## Code Explanation
The code can be divided into two main part. 
1. The first part is to solve the satellitesâ€™ ECEF position.
2. The second partis using LS method to solve the receiver position and clock offset
3. The flowchart is as follows,
